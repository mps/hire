      <p>Hey love, I miss you.  It has been good to FaceTime and see you and the family the past
        couple of days.  Those moments definitely make the time away easier to manage.  I am trying
        to overcome the jet lag that happens when you travel.  They days are long but the nights feel
        short because I wake up at odd hours.  Right now it is 6 AM and I have been up since 3 AM but hopefully
        tomorrow the sleep will get better and my energy will return.
      </p>
      <p>Yesterday, we arrived at 5 AM and I went to sleep for a few hours.  After that we went to
        lunch at Shake Shack (HAHA) and then met with the Chick-fil-A team here in Singapore at their office.
        The office is a shared co-working space that is kind of small.  After the office, we went to 
        the shopping area in town to visit other quick service food brands like Popeyes, McDonalds and other places
        that are local to Singapore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today is Saturday, I am going to be working out and walking around the city.  I may get a massage
        to see if that helps me relax and sleep better.  The culture here is very kind.  The city is very clean.
        Most people live in an Apartment as the city is very expensive to own property.  It kind of reminds me of a 
        smaller Manhattan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well I am off to try and sleep for another hour and then make my way out into the city.  I will call soon.  Thanks
        for how you have helped your mom and be a leader.  I love you!
      </p>
      <p>Daddy</p>

      <p>Hey Ella, I'm leaving today to go on a long work trip and I am going to miss you dearly.  You mean the world to me and your mom and we are so very proud of you.  
        Over the next few weeks while I am gone, I will be writing you letters to let you know how things are going and what I am learning.  While I am away, be a leader
    for your Mom and Mimi, look out for your brothers and sister, and continue to pray for me.</p>
    <p>Love you always my Snicker, talk to you tomorrow!</p>
    <p>Daddy</p>
